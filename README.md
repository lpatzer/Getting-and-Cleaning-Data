Getting and Cleaning Data Project
=========================

### Introduction
This repo includes code for the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.  The code assumes that the raw data already sits on your local machine.  

### Background on Data
The data provided for this project was wearable data with a total of 561 columns and 11000 rows.  The data was split between testing and training sets, which are combined in the code in this repo.  Additionally, many columns had poorly formatted names, which were also adjusted.

### Tidy Data
The final output of the code in this repo is a tidy dataset.  This dataset is limited to relevant columns (means and standard deviations) and the formatting changes mentioned above have been included.
