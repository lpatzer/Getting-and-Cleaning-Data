Getting and Cleaning Data Project - Codebook
=========================

### Data Source
The data used for this exercise was from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  The original data is posted here: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### About the data
The accelerometers collected multiple data points, including velocity and acceleration at a constant rate of 50Hz as volunteers particpated in physical activities such as walking and going down stairs.  Together all the data captured, makes a complete picture of the 3-dimensional movement of the wearer.

### Data Clean up
To make the data easier to use, I have added the column headers to the data set.  I have also modified these column headers to avoid abbreviations
- 't' became 'time'
- 'f' became 'frequency'
Additionally, instead of using codes for each of the physical activities, the name of the activity was included.
